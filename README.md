# Ryujin SMHW
Unofficial desktop client for Show My Homework, made in Svelte and Electron.

## Installation
No binaries are available, however if anyone cannot build themselves then I can supply some.

### Prerequisites
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) Any version should do, however I use the latest features build (14.8.0 at time of writing)
- [NPM](https://npmjs.org) Typically comes installed with node.js, can install required packages.

### Install packages
Firstly, install all required packages to run Ryujin SMHW by using `npm install` in a suitable command prompt of your choice, this should be quick.

### Launch the client
Next, you can use `npm start` in the same command prompt to start the client, a log-in prompt will appear however will only appear once if the "Remember me" box is checked.

### Build the client
To build the client into an executable (`.exe`), run `npm run make`. This should automatically detect your system and package all of the files and assets for a distributable executable.
